# About Yasumi

Yasumi (Japanese for 'Holiday'「休み」) is the easy PHP library that helps you retrieve the dates and names
of holidays and other special celebrations from various countries/states. It is calculation and rule driven avoiding the
need of a comprehensive database.

Many services exist that can provide holiday information, however are either not entirely free or only offer limited
information. In addition, no exhaustive PHP library exists today covering a wide range of holidays and
countries. [PEAR's Date_Holidays](https://pear.php.net/package/Date_Holidays) library was a similar attempt, however it
hasn't been updated for a long time.

## Highlights

The goal of Yasumi is to be powerful while remaining lightweight, by utilizing PHP native classes
wherever possible. Yasumi's calculation is provider-based (i.e. by country/state), making it easy to add
new holiday providers that calculate holidays.
